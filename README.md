# Intro to Node.js Websockets Workshop

Learn how to handle asynchronous communication via websockets! In this workshop, you'll be making your own websocket controller to interact with the presenter's computer. Your goal is to get as many coins as possible by the end of the meeting.

## Attendee

This is most likely you! Here's what you need to learn all about websockets

### Prerequisites

git - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
npm - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

### Setup / How to Run

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/IEEE-UC/intro-to-websocket-project.git
```

Install the ws library:

```
npm run setup
```


To run your code run:

```

```

You'll be running that command each time you make changes to your code!

Customize your player by changing the name and color of your meeple.

### YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR SECRET

The secret is how the server tells meeples apart. If you and another player have the same secret you'll both be controlling the same meeple! D:
